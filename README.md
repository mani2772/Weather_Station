# Weather_Station

Weather Monitoring Station using **Arduino and IoT**. Designed and implemented for real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Weather Station IoT System** capable of measuring and transmitting **temperature and humidity** data in real time.  
The system uses sensors and microcontrollers to collect environmental data and display it locally as well as over the cloud for remote monitoring.  

**Key Features:**
- Measures **Temperature** and **Humidity** using DHT11/DHT22 sensor  
- Displays readings on **LCD display (16x2)**  
- Transmits data to **IoT platform (ThingSpeak / Blynk / MQTT)**  
- Designed for **low power operation and continuous data logging**  
- Can be powered via **5V adapter or USB**
